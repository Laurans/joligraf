# Joligraf

Joligraf is a project that aims to regroup high-level data visualization graph as TSNE / UMAP interactive projection, or confusion matrix, etc...

## Motivations

1. I was repeating myself when it comes to create visualisation. Matplotlib or other visualization libraries are great tools but I was redefining the confusion matrix or other graph each time I needed one.
2. For some plot as TSNE or UMAP projection, I need it more interactive and be able to find the image source I looking at.

## How to use it
